An open source (licensed with GPL 2.0 and above) Java-program to do polyphonic pitch detection from standard audio in. Does not seem to work as expected (or rather I expected it to work, but it didn't. Conversely one might have expected for it not to work, which it didn't..). Possibly a bug in the code I have been unable to locate, but additionally, I am under the impression that regular sound card audio in is a bit noisier than optimal for pitch detection. Takes some time to fire up after you press the Begin pitch detection button. Sometimes needs to be restarted in order to initiate the sound capture (another indication that there probably is a bug in the code..).

I started the project with the hopes of creating polyphonic pitch detection to be used in a Frets of Fire/Guitar Hero type game by pluggin an actual electric guitar into the audio in. Also, tuning guitar with polyphonic pitch detection would be pretty nifty (http://www.tcelectronic.com/polytune.asp).

I made an attempt to implement a polyphonic pitch detection method described in Anssi Klapuri's (list of publications http://www.cs.tut.fi/~klap/iiro/ and http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/people/anssik/publications.htm) congress publication
